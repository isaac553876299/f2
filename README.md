# Apollo
## Physics Project based on SDL2
- The goal of this demo project is to recreate a realistic physics world, placed in outer space, where you must command a spaceship from Earth to the Moon and grab the sphere containing nuclear materials to complete the mission.
- Avoid asteroids on your ways, also do not land on moon at the highest speed as it will crush your very core too.
- Apparently there is some fluid floating near Earth's athmosphere, unexplored.

## Controls
- Keyboard arrows to command direction angle of propulsation.
- Space bar to apply impulse on opposite direction of direction angle (that is back of spaceship).
- D key to draw colliders.

## Physics applied
- Gravity.
- Impulses.
- Buoyancy.
- aero drag.
- also collisions (inelastic).
